## General info
This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Its goal is to practice with:

- HTTP Requests & Routes
- Creating layouts and page design
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Tecnologies
- Node
- Express
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Setup
Fork the project Github repo, and then clone or download the zip file locally. Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install Javascript packages:

```
cd <project directory>
npm install
```
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

In the .env_sample file declare your API key:

```API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE```
